# CSCE2110SimCity
Project function:
This project simulates the growth of city-- the changes and expansions of various economic zones and the effects of pollution.

This project can be used to predict the amount of pollution from the economic zones, which can be applied to related concepts, such as climate change.

This program will first request the filename of the simulation configuration file-- which should contain a region layout filename, number of time steps, and refresh rate. Then, it will output the initial region.

This project was made by CSCE 2110.207, Group 7:

Sanjana Anand

Karyl Fajardo

As  of Milestone 1, compile Proj1.cpp as is.

Make sure that a configuration file with the region layout filename, number of time steps, and refresh rate is within reach.

Make sure initial region layout file is within reach.

As of 3/8/2024, compile using main_1_.cpp, industrial_1_.cpp, residential.cpp, city_1_.cpp, and cell.cpp.



How to run:
The program will request the configuration filename, then will be able to access all necessary information from there. (config1)

It will output the initial region layout.

There should also be a time step, available goods, and avaiable workers message shown.
